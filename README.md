It‚Äôs not a cryptocurrency, it‚Äôs not an NFT, it‚Äôs not a token. It is a chain story contract.

A chain story is an organically grown story created by an organically grown group of people using a smart contract.

The idea is to create a continuing story by new authors using a smart contract. New authors submit their version of the next part of the story. Past authors of the story judge and vote on the story submissions of the new authors. A winning submission becomes part of the story and its author can now judge future story submissions. It is a story guided by its past authors and written by its new authors. The rules and how it works are enforced by a smart contract.

The story is about an Aavegotchi or Aavegotchis and their adventures.

Aavegotchis are adorable digital ghosts, the spirits of liquidated yield farmers, brought to life in a gaming world. Find out more about Aavegotchis here: https://www.aavegotchi.com/
